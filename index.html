                <p>When the scan is finished, the worker is shown a report. The same expanding panels are used to allow the worker to view more information if they choose to. The status of each panel is shown even when the panel is closed, so at a glance, the worker can tell if there is a problem in the panel they need to bring their attention to.</p>
                <p>If there are errors or warnings, they are listed at the top of the expanded panel. The worker can then fix the issues and then run the scan again to ensure that there are no more problems.</p>
