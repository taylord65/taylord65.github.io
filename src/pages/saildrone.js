                                  Saildrone utilizes a fleet of autonomous drone sailboats to collect
                                  high resolution ocean data. I worked closely with the COO to create
                                  a desktop web application that clients can use to easily plan and
                                  manage their ocean data collection missions.

                                    creating an account.

                                      explore. GPS coordinates are displayed over the cursor for users

                                      side panel as you choose them. Navionics API for google maps was
