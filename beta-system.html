        <h5 class="subheader">General Changes</h5>
        <strong>Search Field Added</strong>
        <p>Search fields were added to both the organizer/beacon pairing screen and the selection screen for locating people. The field is displayed automatically at the top of both screens. This change was made in accordance with the discoverability principle of “if a user cannot find it, it does not exist”. The user no longer has to scroll through a list of what could be any number of beacons/people becoming frustrated in the process and running the risk of never finding the desired list item. They can simply search for the beacon/person they have in mind, speeding up the setup process.  </p>
        <strong>Pull Down to Refresh</strong>
        <p>Swiping down on a phone in a list screen is a common interaction used in many applications to refresh the list. It has been implemented in the organizer/beacon pairing screen and the selection screen for locating people. Previously the user would have to back out and re enter the screen for an updated list. Now the use case of refreshing to detect is considered to be optimized as it is a familiar interaction to users of phone applications. In case some of our users are unfamiliar with this interaction, a brief dialog popup is displayed at the bottom informing users to pull to refresh.  </p>
        <h5 class="subheader">Organizer/Beacon Pairing</h5>
        <strong>Improved states of Beacon detection</strong>
        <p>Previously it was not clear to users what should be expected at this screen. Users can be confused as to what kind of information they are trying to populate this screen with. If there are no beacons detected, it is now more apparent to the user. An image of a beacon with signal waves emanating from it and an X as well as the text “It looks like there are no beacons around you…” lets the user know that at this point they should be trying to discover and connect beacons, informing them of the interaction goal. When a beacon has been detected, the X will disappear and the text will change to “1 beacon detected :)”. A dialog popup will also be briefly displayed with the text “Awesome! Beacon was detected :)” This provides more feedback that the user is on the right track and that they have accomplished a significant usability task of detecting a beacon. </p>

        <h5 class="subheader">Objectives</h5>
        <p>Our proposal presented four objectives:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>the application needed to be simple and devoid of any extraneous features</li>
          <li>the system did not require prior interaction between the administrator/organizer, the locator (person looking for person of interest), and the person of interest</li>
          <li>the system did not require the person of interest to have a smartphone or any equipment prior to being made available on the application</li>
          <li>the system did not use GPS, since it needed to be effective indoors</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This beta prototype meets all four objectives. The application is extremely simple, with only 5-6 steps required to have the system ready for use. An administrator can register people of interest on the application and give them beacons, and they will instantly show up on the "locator" interface on the phones of people who have never met them. Since we use beacons as the target, the person of interest does not require a smartphone or any equipment other than the beacon assigned to them. The system uses Bluetooth signals to estimate the distance of a beacon instead of GPS, which is not effective indoors and would require additional equipment.</p>
