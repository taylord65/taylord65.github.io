        <h5 class="subheader">Script</h5>
        <p>We are currently working on developing a system that can aid with locating persons of interest in a confined setting.</p>
        <b>Observer Briefing</b>
        <p>Thank you for volunteering your time to test our system. We will use the results of this experiment to identify problems in our system or areas that need improvement so that we can provide a better experience for the user. Before we start with the experiment, we (I) have a few short questions to ask you (see pretest questionnaire). </p>
        <p>You will be given a paper prototype of the system we are developing and we are (I am) going to ask you to perform a series of simple tasks.  You do not need any type of special preparation for it. We (I) will tell you what each task is ahead of time but I will not tell you how to do it. When you perform the tasks, it would be very helpful if you could guide us (me) through your thought process. We (I) will simulate the behaviour of the application by changing the screen but you should pretend that we (I) am not here. At the end of the experiment, we will ask you a few short questions about the system and the test.</p>
        <p>You are strongly encouraged to be honest with your feedback; we need any and all kinds of feedback in order to improve our system. We (I) will be taking notes but keep in mind that you are not being evaluated on how well you perform the tasks. It is the system that we are evaluating and not you. If you are okay with it, we are going to film the test. We can hide your face if you prefer.  If some things are unclear during the test, do not hesitate to ask us(me) questions. If you need to take a break or pause the experiment, just let us (me) know and we will pause it. </p>
        <p><b>Question to be asked during test:</b> <br />
          If a user struggles to perform a task:
          <blockquote>I can see that you are struggling with task X. Can you tell me why/what you are looking for?</blockquote></p>
        <b>Pre-test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>
          <li>When you go to a conference, job fair, convention, hackathon, how often are you trying to locate a person of interest?</li>
          <li>How do you go about looking for this person, or how would you go about looking for this person?</li>
          <li>Do you have any experience with apps that allow you to find people of interest (find my friends, etc.)? If so, how is your experience (regular use vs used it once, helpful or not helpful)</li>
          <li>If you had to look for someone but could not call them, how would you proceed to look for them?</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 class="subheader">Test Plan #1</h5>
        <p><b>User:</b> Not a person of interest, but someone who wishes to find a person of interest</p>
        <p><b>Benchmark Tasks:</b> Find a person of interest</p>
        <b>Script to preface task for user</b>
        <p>You are at a career fair, you see a sign on the wall that advertises a “Locator App” to find people at the career fair. (It tells you to download the app from the app store and use this access code [XXX-XXX]). You download the app and open it. You have heard of John Smith, he is the CEO of a company you are interested in applying to. You want to use the app to find him. Your task is to find John Smith in real life. The career fair is very crowded, there are people everywhere. </p>

        <p><b>Question to be asked during test:</b> <br />
        Ask the user what the triangle indicator/number means</p>

        <b>Usability Goals:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrive at group user list screen within 2 minutes of opening the app.</li>
          <li>The user presses join a group/track a beacon within 10 seconds</li>
          <li>The user does not press Create a group/ Register a beacon at all</li>
          <li>The user types in the correct access code on the first try</li>
          <li>The user understands the triangle/distance number indicator by confirming its use after being asked.</li>
          <li>The user finds the person of interest who is partially hidden 5m away within 30 seconds.</li>
          <li>The user should be able to perform all activities with minimal help from external sources</li>
          <li>If the user makes an error, they should be able to correct it without assistance from the facilitator</li>
          <li>Satisfaction rating above 3 in post test questionnaire</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Rationale for usability goals:</b>

        <p>We want the user to quickly arrive at the screen where he can track the person of interest. The user shouldn’t be confused about the group system, and he/she should know that creating a group or registering beacons is not in the scope of the designated task. We want the user to know that the access code from the sign is used for the app, so the user should be able to enter it correctly on the first try. We want to ask the user what the triangle indicator/number means because we want to confirm that they know it indicates the distance to the person. It should be obvious and they shouldn’t be confused when asked. Finding the person who is 5m away should be an easy task so it should be completed within 30 seconds. Overall, the app should be easy to use: it should not add an unnecessary layer of complexity to the task. Most tasks should thus be learned and performed in a minimal time frame. </p>

        <h5 class="subheader">Test Plan #2</h5>
        <p><b>User:</b> An administrator</p>
        <p><b>Benchmark Tasks:</b> Create a group, name the group, add a beacon, add a name, upload a picture of user, repeat for second kid, remove a kid, add a new kid.</p>
        <b>Script to preface task for user</b>
        <p>You are a dad going to the park with your 2 kids (Pedro and Pablo) and you want to keep track of them. You have the app downloaded to your phone and 2 spare ibeacons. You are at the park and you sit down at a table, you place the ibeacons in front of you and open up the app on your phone. Your two kids are in front of you. You want to set it up so you can track your kids at anytime. What do you do? </p>
        <p><small>[once second kid has been set up]</small><br />Pablo gives his beacon to you and he goes home. Pedro runs into his friend Ryan at the park, you need to supervise Pedro and Ryan, you want to add Ryan to your group to be able to locate him as well. How do you do this?</p>

        <b>Usability Goals:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The user presses Create Group/ Register beacon within 10 seconds</li>
          <li>The user does not press Join a group/track a beacon at all</li>
          <li>The user adds the first child by clicking a beacon id, renaming it to Pedro or Pablo,</li>
          <li>The user takes a picture of the child they just entered.</li>
          <li>The user repeats the process with no errors for the other child</li>
          <li>The user removes Pablo </li>
          <li>The user presses + Add a new user</li>
          <li>The user repeats the process for Ryan with no errors.</li>
          <li>The user should be able to perform all activities with minimal help from external sources</li>
          <li>If the user makes an error, they should be able to correct it without assistance from the facilitator</li>
          <li>Satisfaction rating above 3 in post test questionnaire</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Rationale for usability goals:</b>

        <p>We expect the user to know that he is the administrator and that creating a group/registering a beacon is the only option for his role, thus it should be completed quickly. The system should easily guide the user through the setup process so the user should be able to meet all the goals of adding the kids. All these incremental steps should be accomplished in succession without errors. Again, because the app is a tool to help users perform a task, it should be easy to learn and use and should not add an unnecessary layer of complexity to the task. </p>

        <b>Post-test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>
          <li>Generally, how do you find your encounters with the system, on a scale of 1 to 6, where 1 is not useful at all and 6 is very useful?
          <li>What are your suggestions for improving the system? Is there a feature you wished you had access to?</li>
          <li>What did you like the most about the system?</li>
          <li>What did you like the least about the system?</li>

        <b>Pre test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>
          <li>Never</li>
          <li>Never had to</li>
          <li>Used Find my friends. Intrusive, the app was slow</li>
          <li>Try landmark that was used previously</li>
        </ol>
        <b>Post Test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>
          <li>1 unsatisfactory</li>
          <li>Did not like the group system, too complex, not applicable. The distance symbol is not intuitive. You should be able to focus on a single person you are tracking. You wouldn’t be looking for multiple at once. Wish I had orientation to the target and actual units of distance to them.</li>
          <li>It's simple</li>
          <li>Not enough guidance with the interface - make buttons clearer, info popups, etc. Lack of feedback.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 class="subheader">Subject #2 <small>Prototype 2</small></h5>
        <b>Pre test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>
          <li>Have been to a college fair, often am trying to locate a person of interest.</li>
          <li>Use maps, signs, and informational booths to find person of interest.</li>
          <li>Used an app that allowed friends to keep track of one another while out drinking. The experience was not very good, didn’t work half the time. People will not turn it on before they start drinking.</li>
          <li>Yell for them, use an information booth.
        </ol>
        <b>Post test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>
          <li>4 useful</li>
          <li>Sounds to guide you as well as better visual representatioin to guide you, but something other than just distance number read out. There should be an option to differentiate beacon with friends and beacons with kids. Want to locate your kid faster than a friend. So priority of users. Maybe should use bluetooth from phones as well to locate people, people don’t want to buy beacons.</li>
          <li>Simple, straightforward, easy for anyone, not many options.</li>
          <li>Did not like the selection process of selecting beacons, why can’t you set up multiple at the same time? Did not like the possibility of an invasion of privacy (some random person finding your location.)</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 class="subheader">Subject #3 <small>Prototype 1</small></h5>
        <b>Pre test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>
          <li>Very often trying to find a person of interest at a large gathering. Would be useful at comic con for example.</li>
          <li>Use phone, text message, place of interest.</li>
          <li>Know of Viber, whatsapp, find my friends. Haven’t used any.</li>
          <li>Use a place of interest to find someone without assistance.</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Post test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>
          <li>5 useful</li>
          <li>Be able to click on someone and only track one person, view their profile with signal strength. Floor plan of the location would be nice. Make removing a user easier, should just be able to rename a beacon, not look for it again and re add it. Want to be able to save people in your system so you don’t have to constantly add them. Be able to upload a photo instead of taking one as an option. Be able to page another beacon.</li>
          <li>Good concept. Useful in theme parks, outdoor rec facility, tour groups, travelling, airports. Good for getting people to whom they have to be with. </li>
          <li>Looks like 4square.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5 class="subheader">Subject #4 <small>Prototype 2</small></h5>
        <b>Pre test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>
          <li>Been to one or two large events, enough times to need assistance finding someone.</li>
          <li>Call them, set up a spot to meet at.</li>
          <li>No experience with other apps.</li>
          <li>Go back to a place where you originally saw them and see if they would do the same thing.</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Post test Questionnaire</b>
        <ol>=
          <li>5 useful</li>
          <li>Visualization of where they are at using a map feature. Give you a general idea of where the beacon is. Maybe a beeping noise if you are going to far away. Be able to only register a person once and save their beacon to your system. Track multiple people, make use of map. Units beside the number. Didn’t know if it was 20 feet or 20 meters.</li>
          <li>Liked how it is only a one way connection, you don’t need them to accept the tether, you can find them right away without the hassle of authorization.</li>
          <li>There is no guidance, no compass, or bearing for direction</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Conclusions</b>
        <p>This time the user was able to create a group. However he initially did not add any beacons and was taken to a blank group list screen. He was stuck her for a while and did not see the Add new button at the bottom. After some assistance he was able to go through and add both kids. He wanted to click multiple beacon ids since he knew he needed to add 2 people. He tried to click multiple beacon id and kept checking the track boxes. The user didn’t have any trouble removing and re adding a user.</p>
        <b>Suggested improvements</b>
        <p>Only unassigned beacons should show up as options and you should be able to quickly add 2 at the same time. The Add new button on the group list screen should be more apparent and descriptive. Something like Add New User/ Add New Person of Interest. Its also not obvious what happens when the user checks the checkboxes. Nobody ever selected the other tab to see them. Should re work the functionality for tracking individuals. There may be problems mixing up beacons with people, we need to make sure this does not occur.</p>

        <b>Conclusions</b>
        <p>The subject pressed “Create a group” instead of the intended “Join a group”. This led him down the wrong path and he kept getting more and more confused as nothing in this user flow makes sense for tracking a person. The subject was not able to figure out how to reset the application and return to the home screen. The test had to be ended and we tried again where we told him to try the “Join a group” option. He was then able to enter the access code and view the people to track.</p>
        <b>Suggested improvements</b>
        <p>Removing the feature of groups or at least giving more context to the group system are options. A clearer way to reset the system and return to home should be included to avoid the user from becoming lost. The indicator for closeness to a person has too many things trying to describe it. The word distance is above signal strength icons. The user understands these two concepts are linked but he has to make that association on his own. The current indicator is not completely obvious as to what it does. </p>

        <b>Conclusions</b>
        <p>User tried registering multiple beacons at a time after handing both beacons to the kids. We told him only singular registration is possible and he added them individually. Again there could be an issue of handing a wrongly assigned beacon to a kid. The second half of the test, removing Pablo and adding Ryan, is not supported in this prototype. There is no way to remove a person from a group.</p>
        <b>Suggested improvements</b>
        <p>The device pairing screen should indicate the user that these are unassigned beacons. We should consider the ability to just add the names next to the beacons and press enter. We also need to incorporate a picture assigning process so that it is a necessary step. A way of renaming a beacon from Pablo to Ryan is necessary. </p>

        <b>Conclusions</b>
        <p>The user was able to track a beacon and arrive at the user list screen. He had to be reminded who he was looking for and asked if he could go back. He tried clicking on the name and nothing happens. He also thought the number was in kilometers away. He was not aware that this was the screen that was used to track someone. He found it not very useful since he didn’t know what to do at this point. He found the process of locating someone to be relatively easy.</p>
        <b>Suggested improvements</b>
        <p>Have a person's name clickable where you can only track them. Units are necessary next to the number. The user list screen should make it more obvious that these people are around you and you can track them by glancing at this screen or track individuals by clicking on their names.  </p>

Lack of security: The user has only the option to return to the home screen, he can’t go back. Not very effective, the user has trouble adding a new beacon. Confusion between creating new group or adding new beacon</p>
        <b>Suggested improvements</b>
        <p>Implementing a tutorial within the app at the beginning of the app in order to demonstrate the workflow. Implement a back button to allow easier navigation. </p>

        <b>Suggested improvements</b>
        <p>Make the done button more meaningful, more expressive. Instead of "Done", it should indicate what the process is "Pairing...", "Home", etc. Make a tutorial that goes trough the process. The "add picture" feature should be more intuitive. </p>

        <p>The user had a good understanding of how to use the beacons. He found the task to be relatively simple and was able to pair his beacons in minimal time. The user was receptive and did not raise major concerns. Overall, the system seems to allow the user to perform the necessary task. </p>
        <b>Suggested improvements</b>
        <p>The use of radio buttons seemed to confuse the user. Instead, the choices could be inside a clickable box. As stated previously, the user initially thought that two beacons could be paired at the same time. In order to solve this problem, a short text indicating that ‘only one beacon can be paired at a time’ could be displayed. Alternatively, once a beacon is selected, the remaining in-range options could be changed to another colour, or fade in the background.</p>

        <p>The prototype allowed the user to complete the task needed in minimal time. No major issues were encountered. The user had a very good understanding of the meaning of the distance increasing or decreasing and had no trouble finding the person of interest. However, we should note that the experiment was set in a confined setting where there was only one possible person to find. In a real-life application, the user may have found the task more complex if more than one person of interest was present. </p>
        <b>Suggested improvements</b>
        <p>The use of radio buttons was perhaps a bit unclear. A clickable box may be preferred. </p>

        How much time it takes to use the interface and how likely it is for the user to make mistakes?</p>
        <p><b>Utility: have good utility</b><br />
        Does the system provide all the functionality that user needs?</p>
        <p><b>Learnable: easy to learn</b><br />
        Can users figure out what to do by exploring the interface?</p>
        <p><b>Memorable: easy to remember how to use</b><br />
        How easy is it to remember how to use an interface after the user has experience with the system?</p>
        <p><b>Safe: safe to use</b><br />
        What kind of errors can users make and how can they recover from the mistake?</p>
        <h5 class="subheader">Conclusions</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The user was initially confused by the radio buttons</li>
          <li>Poor efficiency: the interface is confusing for the user, he doesn’t know if he should pick 2 beacons at the time or one</li>
          <li>The user made mistakes (e.g. choosing two beacons at a time); the facilitator had to intervene</li>
          <li>The user was able to find the person of interest quickly and had no trouble understanding </li>
          <li>The use of numbers indicating the distance to the person of interest was easy to understand for the user.</li>
          <li>Overall however, the user was able to learn the app in a minimal time frame</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="subheader">Suggestions</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Make clear that we are using radio-buttons and not checkboxes </li>
          <li>A more complex prototype will not allow the user to select two beacons at a time. Alternatively a short text indicating that ‘only one beacon can be paired at a time’ could be displayed. The remaining options could also be pushed to the background, or faded out.</li>
