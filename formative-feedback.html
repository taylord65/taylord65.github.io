        <p>Overall users showed interest in the concept and thought it was a good idea. All users were able to place and customize reference in a reasonable amount of time. Although one user took more than 30 seconds to place the first reference point, they learned the task relatively quickly and were able to place all additional reference points under the 30 sec time limit. All users found customizing the reference point to be easy and were able to complete the task within 15 seconds of creating the reference point (depending on typing speed). We can therefore safely conclude that the system is relatively easy to use and easy to learn. </p>
        <h5 class="subheader">Differences between users</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>One user had problems deleting the pin that was set previously, but this wasn’t the case for all the users. Scrolling down to delete the pin wasn’t intuitive. </li>
          <li>How to hide the keyboard when it wasn’t required anymore was not intuitive </li>
          <li>Users who had self identified has having a poor sense of direction had more trouble placing the reference points on the map whereas users who describe themselves as having a good sense of direction could easily place the pins.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="subheader">Usability issues by priority</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>The delay between facing the correct orientation and the vibration needs to be minimal or else the user could possibly feel vibrations from incorrect orientations. This could lead the user on an incorrect walking path and proper navigation would not be achieved. </li>
          <li>It was unclear to User #2 how to hold your arm in order for the watch to obtain the proper orientation reading. The user was confused if the app was still working if he held his arm by his side. </li>
          <li>If two locations are close enough together, the vibration patterns could get mixed together. </li>
          <li>Currently, deselecting the ‘disable all points’ option does not enable all points. While disabling all points does indeed disable all points of interest, deselecting the option should enable all points.</li>
          <li>“Done” instead of “Next” when editing the reference point name is a more indicative term of what’s happening</li>

        <a name="tc"></a>
        <p>The evaluation team should comment on the degree to which the test cases address the designers' usability goals, and if improvements were suggested to the test plan, their relevance to the design goals should be justified.</p>
        <p><b>** We were unable to fully test the haptic feedback part of the system as it is still currently in an early prototype phase **</b></p>
        <p>No test focus was identified, e.g ease of learning vs ease of use. Test 1 and test 2 are very similar to one another, there should be more variation in test 2. The Data collection sheet does not have a space for observing what the user is actually doing during each test. This would enhance test results. </p>
        <p>The test cases appropriately address the usability goals specified by the NavSense team. Creating, placing and customizing reference points all relate to the first two usability goals mentioned by the designers. However, some measures were more or less appropriate for the tasks performed. For example, placing a reference point within 30 seconds of opening the application was appropriate in some cases (in cases where the user had a prior knowledge of the location of the target intersection) but in cases where the point of reference was farther away from the user’s initial position, a 30 second limit may not be appropriate. However, customizing the reference point within 45 seconds of opening the app, that is, within 15 seconds after having created the reference point was determined to be feasible. In most cases, users were able to perform the task in less than 10 seconds. </p>
        <p>Usability goals 3, 4, 5 were very difficult to evaluate as they required quantitative measures to tasks that in practice were more easily evaluated qualitatively. In practice, evaluators had trouble assessing whether the vibration patterns corresponded to specific orientations or if they were randomized. Users could feel vibrations but were unable to associate the patterns to specific reference points. Additionally, measuring the suggested orientation in relation to the real orientation was highly imprecise. The current test also does not test whether the user can direct themselves toward a point of interest; rather, it only tests if they can feel and differentiate different vibrating patterns. In order to more accurately test whether the user can successfully orient themselves, a test wherein the user is asked to find a specific building could be designed. A static user will also tend to move keep their arm in the same position whereas a moving user could orient their arm in different orientations, which could possibly affect the results. A perhaps better test would ask the user to walk in the direction of the vibrating pattern. The effect of the user rotating their arm could thus also be investigated. Additionally, the user could more easily correct their trajectory if needed. </p>
        <p>The test plan provided by the designers does not include a Pebble-smartphone pairing test. All users will need to independently pair their pebble watch to the application. There could be several usability issues associated with this process, none of which are taken into consideration. The test should begin with no locations on the map and the pebble watch not connected since this is what a user would start out with. </p>
        <p>The test should also cover more cases where there could be trouble navigating to the location. For example, have two locations on the map that are very close to one another. Then ask the user to navigate to one of the locations. Observe if the user disables the one that is not the target and begins locating the one that is. </p>
        <p>The heuristics covered in the usability evaluation were well developed and appropriate to the system. However, some could have been added, mainly those related to errors (<b>error prevention</b> and <b>help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</b>). Given that this type of application is very dependent on GPS, which is prone to errors in dense urban environments, it is a given that GPS localization errors will eventually happen. However, there are no usability evaluation criterion designed to evaluate how the system reacts to such errors.</p>

        <p>It is not clear that this app requires a pebble watch in the beginning. If a pebble watch has already been interfaced with the app then it is fine to just show the map screen when you open it. Otherwise, there should be a straightforward setup process that guides the user in the connection process.</p>
        <p>It is difficult for a user to create the mapping from vibration pattern to a specific location. For example, there doesn’t seem to be a way of knowing that 2 long vibrations corresponds to a certain building. There should be a way of previewing a vibration pattern for a location. If you could tap a location on the app and feel the vibration it would help the user create the mapping. </p>
        <p>If you are viewing the map, you have to remember or look up the name of each marker. For example, a user may have trouble remembering what location A is. If the name of the marker could be displayed instead or truncated text of the name on the map, then you would avoid the additional step of looking up what each marker is.</p>
        <p>One of the problems with the system is related to placing the reference points. Users with a poor sense of direction (i.e. the target audience of this application) and users who have trouble reading maps took significantly more time to place reference points. In some cases, they may not even know where their target location is on a map. While the NavSense app allows the user to exit the application and use Google Maps to find a certain intersection, it does not allow the user to import a reference point from it. The user must still manually place the reference point. A possible modification to the system would be to allow users to search for a location before placing the reference point. Alternatively, the app could allow for points of interest to be imported from another application. </p>
        <p>Indicating the process steps by using labels (or a quick tutorial at the beginning of the app) will facilitate users interaction with the app from the beginning, making it easier to place the first reference point. An example is just going step by step through the process, displaying the steps to the user: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click on the + in order to display the pin pointing to the required location.</li>
          <li>Move the map in order to precisely pin the required location</li>
          <li>Once location precisely identified, click checkmark to validate location</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Additionally, as indicated in the observations section, users intuitively dragged the pin before dragging the map. While dragging the map allows for improved accuracy, it is not as ‘intuitive’ as moving the reference point marker. In order to solve this problem, a small text box at the top of the screen could indicate that the user needs to “drag the map around to place your reference point”  when the ‘add a reference point’ option is selected. </p>
        <p>The use of a switch to disable reference points was also somewhat confusing to some users. When the switch is enabled, it is unclear if all points are disabled or enabled. Using the term ‘enable all points’ would perhaps eliminate the confusion. Also, while selecting the ‘disable all points’ option successfully disables all reference points, unselecting the option does not enable all points. The user needs to manually reselect all reference points they would like to use. Deselecting the ‘disable all points’ option should allow all previously enabled points to be re-enabled. </p>
        <p>If there are more than 3 reference points identified, it’s not intuitive that we need to scroll down through the list of reference points. As a suggested, the most recent reference point should be at the top of the list, not at the bottom, therefore removing the need for the user to scroll down until the last element in order to edit/delete that reference point. </p>
